								"Moderate: Next.js is known for its great developer experience, and many developers find it relatively easy to get started, especially if they are already familiar with React.",
								"The framework comes with built-in features like file-based routing, static generation (SSG), and server-side rendering (SSR) that abstract away much of the complexity. So, a beginner who knows JavaScript and React can quickly build simple static or dynamic websites."
